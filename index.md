Cypress Investment Club is a parternship, based out of [Cypress, TX],  dedicated to education about investing and finance. We are a group of individuals, with varying levels of skill and knowledge, pulling together resources to learn about investing and to share the risk, workload and fun while we all learn together.

## Joining the Club
Joining the club, as spelled out in the [governing documents], requires an individual to attend at least two meetings, and complete one investment worksheet on a potential company in which to invest.
