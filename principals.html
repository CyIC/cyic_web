    <h4>Invest Regularly, Regardless of the Market Outlook.</h4>
    The best way to start investing is with what you can afford and right now. $10, $20, $50 a month, what ever you can afford. The important thing is to invest on a set schedule over time.
    <h4>Diversify to Reduce Risk.</h4>
    Balance risk and expand investment opportunities by investing in different industries, companies of various sizes.
    <h4>Reinvest All Earnings, Dividends and Profits</h4>
    Reinvest and buy more shares. Continue to grow by all means. Cash sitting in a bank does not pay enough to cash actively working for you.
    <h4>Buy growth stocks</h4>
    Inline with our objective, we need to earn 14.9% compounded annually in order to double our investment in 5 years. This is not a sprint, but slow, steady growth.
