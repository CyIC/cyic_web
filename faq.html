<h3>How do I join?</h3>
Membership is dependent on an applicant attending two meetings and successfully submitting a Stock Checklist for
consideration. After submitting a stock checklist, a unanimous vote of the partners is required to accept an applicant.

<h3>Is this club subject to SEC regulations?</h3>
SEC has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investor-pubs-invclub">specific rules</a> for
investment clubs. Because of these rules, we are not open to the public for investment, and members need to be active
in evaluating and voting on proposed securities.
